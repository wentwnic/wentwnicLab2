# Explanation of Lab 2
The topic I decided to explore for this project was "Gentrification" and I explored 3.5 miles in diameters in 3 different Chinatowns in Seattle, San Francisco, and New York City over 10 years (2013-2023). 

The reason I decided to make these comparisons is because I'm personally interested in urban planning and climate gentrification, so I wanted to explore what people were talking about on Twitter in my hometown and 2 other cities that are known to have gentrification. 

The three word clouds have similarity in the topics they all cover such as systematic racism, police brutality, white flight, and development. However, they each have unique topics they respectively cover such as the tech industry in SF, emphasis on the different boroughs in NYC, and red lining and segregation in SEA. 

I believe the similarities I found can be explained possibly by the paramters I set; I chose chinatowns as my locations, an ethically concentrated location that's pronne to being subjrcted to gentrification. So I think it makes sense that they were all talking about police brutality, white flight, and development. And I thought it was interesting how they all had regionally specific topics to explore. San Francisco/California has been at the center of tech for the last 10 years, so I thought it was interesting how evident people found the introduction of this new sector in the region contributed to gentrification. As for NYC, I'm not as familiar to the regional history/current events but since it's such a big city I understood that there were more gentrification occuring in places that are higher in minority numbers such as Queens, Bronx, and Brooklyn. But that was what distinguished the NYC tweets from other cities. Even though the perimeter was set within Chinatown, people were still talking about different sections of the city. And for seattle, we have a long and prominent history of redlining, so I think that's why people were attributing them as the causes/related topic to gentrification. 

If I had the chance to make these word clouds again/if I do a similar project in the future, I would want to pick locations that I had more knowledge of. Since you're extracting themes from words, you're analyzing the discourse of communities, so I thought it would be more helpful if I was more knowledge of local cultures. 

I didn't really have any expectations for this lab, so I don't have anything particluar to note about this exercise, but one thing I did find interesting was the size of the tweet crawl of the 3 cities. NYC had the biggest, SFC had the second largest, then SEA had the smallest sample sizes.
The tweets are evident to the density of each cities, so that's something to keep in mind for me in the future if there's a chance to do something similar again.
